# COVID19
This repository includes codes that I am playing with the COVID19 data. 

The purpose of this repository is to look at the data for Maryland, and try to

* visualize the comfirmed/death cases by county and zipcode 
* predict the possible important factor for areas with high confirmed/death cases
